# Hacking the Cantor app

The app is the React Native client in `cantor/`. It pairs with nodes, submits
generations, mirrors the library offline, downloads encrypted audio, and plays
it back. Everything it shows comes from a node it has authenticated.

Read `cantor/AGENTS.md` before touching motion or Skia code — the Flicker Law
and the Shapes/Verbs/Clock model are not negotiable and are not repeated here.

## Dependency direction

```text
screens / feature components        render
        ↓
feature controllers and hooks       own screen state
        ↓
domain services and ports           decide
        ↓
protocol / repositories / native and network adapters
```

The core must not import a screen, a WebSocket, or a React Native bridge type.
`core/` is the bottom of the tree and imports nothing above it.

## Module map

| Path | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `src/core/` | `errors`, `text`, `validation`, `protocol` decoders and constants, `storage` primitives, `transport` (the generated manifest constants) |
| `src/security/` | `descriptor` verification, `carrier` and `inner` codecs, `secureTunnel` orchestration, `native` channel factory, `types` |
| `src/backends/` | `BackendConnection` façade, `relaySocket` lifecycle, `requestRegistry`, `applicationResponses` decoders, `pairing`, `storage` |
| `src/runtime/` | `useBackendRuntime` — backend records, connection lifecycles, snapshots, cache hydration, persistence, outbox flush, feature commands |
| `src/features/` | `backends/BackendCard`, `jobs/JobQueue`, `library/LibraryTimeline` and `LibrarySongRow` |
| `src/screens/` | `MainScreen`: composition, navigation, and wiring only |
| `src/library/` | cached library repository, query helpers, and the pure `sync` reducer |
| `src/jobs/` | job repository and the submission outbox |
| `src/audio/` | `AudioRef`, the `LocalAudioStore` port, its repository implementation, and the native bridge |
| `src/identity/` | phrase derivation, mnemonic, and keychain-backed identity |
| `src/motion/`, `src/onboarding/`, `src/theme/` | the motion engine and the onboarding experience |

## The rules that are not obvious

**`BackendConnection` is the app-facing façade.** Its internals — socket
lifecycle, secure tunnel, request registry, transfer and sync state machines —
are replaceable. Its surface should not churn.

**One atomic request registration.** `RequestRegistry` binds the expected
response, decoder, resolver, and timeout together. A request registered any
other way will leak or resolve twice.

**Native filesystem state is authoritative for audio.** `LocalAudioStore`
inspects the device rather than trusting a cached flag. If you add advisory
state, reconcile it explicitly.

**Library sync is a pure reducer.** `library/sync/state.ts` returns
`{state, effects}`. Keep decisions there and side effects at the caller, so
reconnect, revision conflicts, and resume are testable without a socket.

**Draft reset behavior is characterized, not improved.** The current
song-draft reset on a remote revision is preserved deliberately. A better
dirty-draft conflict policy is separate product work.

**A superseded socket cannot speak.** Only the currently owned socket may start
keepalive, deliver messages, report closure, or schedule a retry.

## Recipes

### Add a screen

1. Create the screen under `src/screens/`, composing feature components.
2. Give it a feature controller hook only when it owns state; otherwise read
   from `useBackendRuntime`.
3. Wire navigation in `MainScreen`. Do not reach around the runtime to open a
   connection.

### Add a feature component

Put it under `src/features/<feature>/`, export it from that feature's
`index.ts`, and keep its styles beside it. Components receive data and
callbacks; they do not call the connection.

### Add a runtime command

1. Add the command to `BackendRuntimeCommands` in
   `src/runtime/useBackendRuntime.ts`.
2. Implement it through the connection façade and the repositories, not
   through a screen.
3. If it mutates persisted state, go through the repository that owns the key —
   `backends/storage.ts`, `library/repository.ts`, `jobs/repository.ts`, or the
   outbox — so storage keys and merge policy stay in one place.

### Add a node request

1. Add the decoder to `backends/applicationResponses.ts`.
2. Add the method to `BackendConnection`, registering the request through
   `RequestRegistry`.
3. Surface it as a runtime command; the screen calls the command.

### Change the native audio or secure bridge

The Kotlin side lives under `cantor/android/app/src/main/java/com/cantor/app/`.
`CantorSecureModule` is only the bridge: session registry plus the canonical
base64 boundary. `SecureChannel` owns Noise and session limits, `FragmentCodec`
and `FragmentReassembler` own record framing. Add JVM tests before moving any
of it; the React Native method names, arguments, return shapes, and error text
are the contract.

## Playback gestures and field lenses

`player/scrubSession.ts` owns a silent seek transaction: pause once, preview on
the shared position clock, seek on release, and resume only if playback was
running before the drag. `SongSurface` finalizes on gesture completion and
unmount. Track replacement cancels ownership so a late release cannot seek the
next song. Ordinary seeks also reconcile the visual clock after native seek.

Circle and Cantor wave share `NativeFieldContent`. Lens changes drive one
retained linear clock (`MORPH_MS = 420`); the drawing eases it once. Pure bar
geometry is shared with the fallback lens in `lenses/cantorWaveGeometry.ts`.
The field's morph module partitions the exact face polygon into 32 wedges,
then interpolates those wedges into bars at the measured Cantor intervals.

## Tests

```sh
cd cantor
npx tsc --noEmit
npx eslint .
npx jest
cd android && ./gradlew app:testDebugUnitTest app:assembleDebug \
  -PreactNativeArchitectures=arm64-v8a
```

Three ESLint warnings are pre-existing (one inline style in
`src/onboarding/panels/kit.tsx`, two inside a generated Gradle report). There
must be zero errors.

Device work uses the physical Android phone. `npm start` runs Metro;
`adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081` is required over USB and is dropped when the
cable is replugged.

## Traps

- **Jest transforms.** `@scure`, `@noble`, and several React Native packages
  ship untranspiled ESM and are listed in `transformIgnorePatterns`. A new
  ESM-only dependency needs to be added there.
- **`core/transport` is generated.** Edit `protocol/transport/v1/spec.json` and
  run the generator; never hand-edit `src/core/transport/generated.ts`.
- **The secure tunnel fails loudly.** Plaintext after the channel opens is a
  fatal failure, not a downgrade to retry.
- **Storage keys are a compatibility contract.** Existing AsyncStorage keys and
  stored JSON shapes must keep loading; per-store corruption policy is
  deliberate.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Does a component call the connection directly?
- [ ] Is the new state owned by exactly one hook or repository?
- [ ] Is every request registered atomically with its timeout?
- [ ] Does offline behavior still work with no socket?
- [ ] Did a persisted key or stored shape change without a migration story?
- [ ] Does motion still follow the Flicker Law in `cantor/AGENTS.md`?
